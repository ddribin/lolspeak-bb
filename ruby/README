lolspeak is an English to LOLspeak translator.  It contains a default dictionary and various helper methods.  The main class is the LOLspeak::Tranzlator class.  Since you typically don't need to use a custom dictionary, you will most likely use the default tranzlator, LOLspeak.default_tranzlator.  Or better yet, use the extensions to String and REXML::Element.  For example:

  "Hi there! You have a cute cat.".to_lolspeak
    -> "oh hai thar! u has cute kitteh."

To install this via Ruby Gems:

  % sudo gem install lolspeak

It also includes a command line application called <tt>lolspeak</tt>.
