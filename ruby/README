lolspeak is an English to LOLspeak translator. It contains a default
dictionary and various helper methods. The main class is the
LOLspeak::Tranzlator class. Since you typically don't need to use a custom
dictionary, you will most likely use the default tranzlator,
LOLspeak.default_tranzlator. Or better yet, use the extensions to String and
REXML::Element. For example:

  "Hi there! You have a cute cat.".to_lolspeak
    -> "oh hai thar! u has cute kitteh."

To install this via Ruby Gems:

  % sudo gem install lolspeak

It also includes a command line application called lolspeak:

  % lolspeak "Hi there! You have a cute cat."
  oh hai thar! u has cute kitteh.
